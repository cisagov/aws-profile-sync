`aws-profile-sync` is a command line utility that simplifies the synchronization
of
[AWS credential profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
across groups of users.

## Installation ##

From source:

```console
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/aws-profile-sync.git
cd aws-profile-sync
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage ##

The utility reads a credentials file looking for magic `#!aws-profile-sync` comments.
It will then fetch the remote content and intelligently integrate it into a new
credentials file.

```gitconfig
[cool-user]
aws_access_key_id = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aws_secret_access_key = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

#!profile-sync ssh://git@github.com/aceofspades/aws-profiles.git branch=master filename=roles -- source_profile=cool-user role_session_name=lemmy-is-god mfa_serial=arn:aws:iam::123456789012:mfa/ian.kilmister

# This line will get replaced

#!profile-sync-stop

# These lines won't be modified by the utility.
# That was a great time, the summer of '71 - I can't remember it, but I'll never forget it!.
```

The utility will replace all the content between the `#!aws-profile-sync` and
`#!aws-profile-sync-stop` lines in the above example.  To do this it will:

- Clone the repository that lives at `git@github.com/aceofspades/aws-profiles.git`.
- Switch to the `master` branch.
- Read the file `roles`.
- Override and replace any values specified after the `--` in the magic line.

A copy of your previous `credentials` file is stored next to it as `credentials.backup`.
